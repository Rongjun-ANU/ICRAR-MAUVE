# 20250713 Literature Review FMR

Great. Here is the origin, development, and resolved (spatially local) form of the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), starting with its discovery by Mannucci et al. (2010) and Lara-López et al. (2010). I trace its observational and theoretical development—including confirmations from local IFU surveys (like CALIFA, MaNGA, SAMI, PHANGS), high-redshift extensions, and variants like the stellar FMR and molecular-gas FMR. I also briefly mention examples from simulations, metallicity calibration considerations, and how the FMR fits into the self-regulation (bathtub) model of galaxy evolution.

## Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR)

The **Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR)** refers to a tight three-parameter correlation between a galaxy’s stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, and star formation rate (SFR). It was first identified in 2010 by two independent teams. Mannucci et al. (2010) showed that star-forming galaxies define a **surface in the 3D space** of $M_\ast$–Z–SFR such that, at a given stellar mass, higher SFRs correspond to systematically lower gas metallicities.  In other words, the well-known mass–metallicity relation (MZR) is **modulated by SFR**: low-mass, vigorously star-forming galaxies are offset to lower metallicity, whereas high-mass or more quiescent galaxies approach the metallicity ceiling.  Around the same time, Lara-López et al. (2010) independently discovered a **“fundamental plane”** relating stellar mass, metallicity, and SFR in the local universe. Both groups reported that this 3D relation has remarkably small scatter (on the order of 0.05 dex in metallicity) and thus captures an essential aspect of galaxy evolution. They dubbed it “fundamental” because it appeared to hold universally for star-forming galaxies and to remain roughly **invariant with redshift** out to at least $z\sim2$–3.

### Evolution (or Lack Thereof) with Redshift

One striking result from the original FMR studies was that **galaxies up to $z\approx2.5$ follow the same $M_\ast$–Z–SFR surface as local galaxies**. Mannucci et al. found no evidence of evolution in the FMR out to $z\sim2.5$, which corresponds to ~80% of cosmic time. Likewise, Lara-López et al. noted that samples of star-forming galaxies at $z\approx0.8$, 2.2, and 3.5 all fell on the same plane defined by SDSS local galaxies (within the uncertainties). This invariance means that the well-known redshift evolution of the *integrated* MZR (galaxies at higher redshift tend to have lower metallicities at a given mass) can be largely explained by **selection effects**: high-$z$ observations sample galaxies with higher SFRs (on average) which occupy a different part of the FMR, rather than an evolution of the relation itself. In fact, when using a projection of the FMR (e.g. $ \mu_{0.32} = \log M_\ast - 0.32\log \text{SFR}$) that minimizes scatter, the metallicity relation shows **no redshift offset** up to $z\sim2.5$. Only beyond $z\gtrsim3$ do significant deviations emerge – for example, galaxies at $z\approx3.3$ were observed to have metallicities $\sim0.6$ dex below the FMR, indicating a genuine evolution at the highest redshifts. Overall, early studies concluded that the FMR is a **universal relation** for star-forming galaxies at least out to $z\sim2$–2.5, making it a powerful benchmark for models of galaxy evolution.

Subsequent observations have largely supported these findings. Numerous intermediate- and high-$z$ surveys (e.g. at $z\sim1$–3) have found that their galaxy samples are broadly consistent with the local FMR when the data are carefully compared. In cases where an offset was reported, it was often attributed to limited dynamic range or systematic differences in metallicity calibration. For instance, some studies initially questioned whether the SFR dependence is truly needed to describe the $M_\ast$–Z relation, suggesting that the observed FMR might arise from sample selection biases or correlations induced by using certain strong-line metallicity calibrations. However, re-analyses of those same datasets have shown that *when using consistent methods*, the expected anti-correlation between SFR and metallicity at fixed mass does appear, and the data **agree with the FMR** defined by SDSS galaxies. For example, *Cresci et al. (2019)* revisited local integral-field spectroscopic surveys (CALIFA, MaNGA) that had reported no SFR–Z correlation, and demonstrated that those data are in fact **fully consistent with the FMR** when statistical biases are accounted for. They also confirmed that distant galaxy samples up to $z\approx2.3$ show no offset from the local relation. Thus, a decade of studies has solidified the view that the FMR is a robust feature of star-forming galaxies, at least up to the epoch when the universe was $\sim3$ Gyr old. At the highest redshifts now accessible (thanks to JWST), there are indications that even the FMR may start to shift (as extreme gas accretion at early times drives metallicities much lower), but this remains an active area of research.

### Variations and Extensions of the FMR

Because of its significance, the FMR has inspired numerous **extensions** and related formulations. One important insight is that the SFR dependence in the FMR is likely a consequence of a more fundamental dependence on **gas content**. Galaxies with larger gas reservoirs both form stars more rapidly *and* have more dilution of metals, so gas mass is a natural third parameter. Indeed, Bothwell et al. (2013) found a tight relation between $M_\ast$, metallicity, and \HI\ gas mass (an “H I-FMR”), potentially even **tighter than the SFR version** in terms of reducing scatter. A few years later, Bothwell et al. (2016) showed that **molecular gas** is a key driver: at fixed stellar mass, metallicity anti-correlates more strongly with a galaxy’s cold gas mass than with its SFR. Using a principle component analysis, they demonstrated that once the **molecular gas surface density** is accounted for, the residual dependence of metallicity on SFR is negligible. In other words, the *underlying* “fundamental” relation may be between mass, metallicity, and **gas content**, with SFR entering only indirectly via the Schmidt–Kennicutt law (since more gas fuels higher SFR). This view is consistent with studies showing that **metallicity depends primarily on $M_\ast$ and gas fraction**, and that the MZR’s scatter with SFR disappears when controlling for gas supply. Such results highlight that the FMR is intimately linked to a galaxy’s fuel for star formation.

Another extension is the so-called **“stellar FMR.”** While the classic FMR deals with gas-phase metallicity (O/H in the ISM), recent work has asked whether a similar three-way relation exists for the **average metallicity of a galaxy’s stars**. Initial evidence suggests it does: using MaNGA data, Looser et al. (2023) found a smooth correlation between stellar mass, SFR, and the light-weighted **stellar metallicity** of local galaxies. In this stellar-FMR, galaxies lying above the star-forming main sequence (strong starbursts) tend to have younger, more metal-poor stellar populations, whereas galaxies below the main sequence (more passive) have older, metal-richer stars. This implies that the *integrated star formation history* of a galaxy also reflects the FMR pattern: systems that sustained high SFRs (often due to ample gas inflow) not only have lower gas-phase metallicities, but over time they build up stellar populations that are slightly lower in metallicity as well. The stellar FMR is still a new concept, but it qualitatively matches theoretical expectations from cosmological models and suggests a continuity between the **instantaneous gas-phase FMR and the long-term chemical evolution** imprinted in stars.

### Resolved FMR on Local Scales

Given the global FMR, a natural question is whether an analogous relation holds on **kiloparsec scales within galaxies**. Do regions inside a single galaxy follow a local mass–metallicity–SFR trend (“resolved FMR” or rFMR)?  Modern IFU surveys (e.g. CALIFA, SAMI, MaNGA, PHANGS-MUSE) allow us to test this by mapping stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_\ast$), gas metallicity, and SFR density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) across galaxies. **Resolved studies have found a strong local mass–metallicity relationship** – regions with higher $\Sigma_\ast$ have higher oxygen abundance, mirroring the global MZR on small scales. However, the role of local SFR is less clear. Several analyses have reported that, *at fixed $\Sigma_\ast$*, there is **little to no correlation between $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and local metallicity**. In other words, once the dependence on stellar mass density is accounted for, regions forming stars more vigorously do not show significantly lower metals than regions forming stars slowly in the same galaxy. This absence of a strong resolved FMR (i.e. negligible $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ effect) was noted, for example, in MaNGA data by Barrera-Ballesteros et al. (2017), who found that local metallicity is almost entirely driven by $\Sigma_\ast$ with **no significant residual trend with SFR**. Similar conclusions have come from other IFU studies – any SFR–metallicity anti-correlation at kpc scales is much weaker than the global one, and is sometimes consistent with zero within uncertainties. This suggests that the **FMR is fundamentally a global phenomenon**: it arises from galaxy-wide processes (like gas accretion or feedback affecting the whole ISM) rather than local variations in star formation efficiency. In fact, some works find that a galaxy’s *total* SFR or starburst status influences the metallicity of all its regions uniformly – e.g. globally star-bursting galaxies tend to have lower metallicity across the disk, whereas more quiescent galaxies have higher metallicities across the board. Thus, a region’s metallicity is tied more to the **galaxy’s overall evolutionary state** (which sets the gas inflow/outflow history) than to the instantaneous SFR in that particular patch. The resolved data reinforce the idea that **metallicity is governed by cumulative, large-scale flows of gas and metals**; local star formation has only a secondary effect. (Notably, very recent IFU studies using advanced statistical tools do detect a slight residual anti-correlation with $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ when averaging over many galaxies, hinting that a weak rFMR might exist. But the dominant predictor of local metallicity is still $\Sigma_\ast$, with any SFR effect an order of magnitude smaller.)

### Physical Interpretation – Self-regulation via Gas Flows

The FMR’s existence and form can be **explained by the self-regulating “bathtub” model of galaxy evolution**, in which galaxies balance inflows, outflows, and star formation. In this framework, a galaxy’s gas-phase metallicity is set by a competition between metal **production** (from star formation), metal **dilution** (by infall of fresh gas), and metal **loss** (via outflows). The **anti-correlation between SFR and metallicity at fixed mass** is a natural outcome: a high SFR indicates the galaxy is experiencing a high gas accretion rate (fueling a starburst). That accreted gas is metal-poor, so it *dilutes* the ISM metallicity even as it boosts star formation. Conversely, a galaxy with a low SFR (relative to its mass) likely hasn’t accreted much new gas recently, allowing its existing gas to remain enriched or even become metal-rich as stars continue to synthesize elements. In effect, **infall drives the SFR–Z anticorrelation** by simultaneously lowering $Z$ and raising SFR. On the other hand, the **stellar mass dependence** of metallicity is attributed to cumulative metal retention: massive galaxies have deeper potentials and can retain metals (or funnel fresh gas into central star formation) more effectively, whereas low-mass galaxies lose a larger fraction of metals to winds. This introduces the primary $M_\ast$–Z slope, on top of which the SFR (infall rate) modulates the metallicity. As Mannucci et al. put it, infall is the dominant effect at high redshift (or lower-mass, high-SFR galaxies), while outflow feedback dominates at low redshift (or higher-mass, low-SFR galaxies), and together with the star formation law, these processes **shape the FMR**. The remarkably small scatter about the FMR (only ~0.05 dex) supports the idea of a fairly **tight equilibrium**: most star-forming galaxies, at least in the local universe, lie on a smoothly varying sequence, rather than undergoing wildly stochastic enrichment events. This is consistent with smooth, continuous gas accretion being a key driver of their growth.

The FMR’s consistency with theory is further evidenced by simulations and models. **Numerical cosmological simulations** (as well as analytic and semi-analytic models) have been able to **reproduce the FMR** in its general form. For example, equilibrium models by Davé et al. (2012) and Dayal et al. (2013) naturally yield a constant FMR over cosmic time. Semi-analytic approaches (e.g. Yates & Kauffmann 2014) and hydrodynamical simulations (e.g. in the IllustrisTNG or EAGLE families) likewise produce a mass–SFR–metallicity relation similar to observations. These models typically invoke the **“gas regulator” scenario**, where inflow, star formation, and outflow reach a steady state. In such a scenario, the metallicity is given roughly by $Z \sim y , M_{\rm gas} / M_{\rm baryon}$ (where $y$ is the yield and $M_{\rm gas}$/$M_{\rm baryon}$ depends on inflow vs. outflow) – naturally leading to higher $Z$ for systems that have converted more of their gas into stars (high $M_\ast$) and lower $Z$ for systems that are gas-rich and vigorously forming stars (high SFR). As noted, adding gas content explicitly tightens the relation, reinforcing the interpretation that **gas supply is the controlling parameter**. Overall, the Fundamental Metallicity Relation is viewed as **strong evidence for self-regulation** in galaxies: it encapsulates how galaxies of a given mass tend toward an equilibrium where inflowing gas feeds star formation and dilutes metals, while feedback and past star formation set the baseline metallicity. Any theoretical model of galaxy evolution must explain not just the existence of the MZR and the star-forming main sequence, but also the fact that these two are linked in a coherent, **non-evolving 3D relation** – the FMR – which appears to govern **galaxy growth across a vast swath of cosmic time**.
