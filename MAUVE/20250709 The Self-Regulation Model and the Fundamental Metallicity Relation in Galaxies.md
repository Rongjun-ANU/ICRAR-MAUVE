This is a literature review focusing first on the self-regulation (“bathtub”) model as the overarching framework, followed by an in-depth exploration of the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR)—its development, observational variants (e.g., HI-FMR, stellar FMR), and its resolved counterparts. I also include connected relationships like the star formation main sequence (SFMS) and mass–metallicity relation (MZR), primarily at low redshift but incorporating relevant high-z studies where useful.

# The Self-Regulation Model and the Fundamental Metallicity Relation in Galaxies

## The “Bathtub” Self-Regulation Model – Big Picture of Star Formation and Metallicity

A powerful framework for galaxy evolution is the **self-regulation** or “**bathtub**” model, which envisions a galaxy’s gas reservoir like water in a tub controlled by inflow and outflow. In this model, the inflow of fresh gas from the cosmic web fuels star formation, while star formation itself consumes gas and drives outflows (via supernova winds). The system rapidly adjusts toward an **equilibrium** where the **star formation rate (SFR)** balances the net gas accretion rate, keeping the gas mass roughly constant over time. In other words, galaxies **self-regulate**: if gas inflow increases, star formation (and outflows) will rise until a new balance is reached, and vice versa. This simple regulator concept was first described in analytic form by models like Bouché et al. (2010) and Davé et al. (2012) – hence the nickname “**bathtub model**”. Lilly et al. (2013) later generalized it by allowing the gas reservoir to evolve, formulating a **gas-regulator model** where the instantaneous gas mass adjusts to track the inflow rate.

One of the elegant outcomes of the self-regulation model is its ability to link multiple observed galaxy scaling relations under one physical picture. **Simon Lilly et al. (2013)** showed that assuming a constant star formation efficiency and wind mass-loading (fraction of gas expelled), the galaxy’s **specific SFR** naturally equals the **specific accretion rate** of its dark halo in equilibrium. This explains the observed near-constancy of specific SFR over cosmic time in star-forming “main sequence” galaxies. It also reproduces the nearly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR known as the **star-forming main sequence (SFMS)**. In fact, because gas must be replenished continuously to sustain star formation over billions of years (gas consumption times are short), the bathtub model underscores that galaxies are fed by steady infall of gas from the intergalactic medium, especially at low redshift (e.g. in the **Virgo Cluster** environment, gas accretion can be modulated by interactions but still necessary).

Crucially, the regulator model also predicts how galaxies enrich with heavy elements. In a simple equilibrium, the **gas-phase metallicity** (oxygen abundance) is set by the balance between metal production (from star formation) and dilution (by inflow) and loss (via outflows), essentially independent of the past history. As Lilly et al. put it, “the metallicity is set by the instantaneous operation of the regulator rather than by the past history”. This insight naturally yields a **mass–metallicity relation** and, notably, a dependency of metallicity on SFR – exactly the kind of **second-parameter** dependence observed in real galaxies. In fact, Lilly et al. demonstrated that a self-regulating system will **naturally produce a `Z(M*, SFR)` relation** (i.e. a 3D relationship between stellar mass, metallicity, and SFR) that remains the same at all epochs _unless_ the efficiency of star formation or outflow strength changes with time. In other words, the regulator model provides a physics-based explanation for the so-called **Fundamental Metallicity Relation** (FMR) and why it might appear universal and non-evolving with redshift.

Overall, the self-regulation (“bathtub”) picture offers the **big picture** context: galaxies gradually convert inflowing gas into stars, while outflows prevent runaway growth, yielding stable star formation rates and predictable chemical enrichment patterns. It ties together the cosmic star formation history, the star-forming main sequence, and the scaling relations of gas and metals in galaxies. For example, Lilly et al. (2013) showed their simple model could **simultaneously** match the observed evolution of specific SFR with cosmic time, the observed mass–metallicity relation at $z\sim0$ and $z\sim2$, _and_ the relation between stellar mass and halo mass, by tuning just two parameters (star-formation efficiency and wind loading). The success of this model suggests that even complex galaxy processes (cooling, feedback, merging, etc.) tend to drive systems toward an equilibrium that can be described by a few global parameters. This provides a useful guiding framework for interpreting observations of nearby disk galaxies (like those in Virgo) as self-regulating engines where gas inflows, star formation, and enrichment are in balance.

## The Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR): Origin and Development

**The Fundamental Metallicity Relation** refers to the empirical discovery that a galaxy’s gas-phase metallicity $Z$ (typically measured as oxygen abundance) is tightly correlated with _both_ its stellar mass $M_*$ and SFR, forming a 3D surface in $(M_*, \mathrm{SFR}, Z)$ space. In 2010, two groups independently reported this three-parameter relationship. **Mannucci et al. (2010)** analyzed SDSS star-forming galaxies and found that the well-known mass–metallicity relation (MZR) is in fact a projection of a more fundamental 3D surface. Galaxies with **higher SFR tend to have lower metallicity at a given mass**, and conversely galaxies with low SFR are more metal-rich for their mass. They showed the local ($z\sim0$) galaxy population defines a tight surface with only $\sim0.05$ dex scatter in $12+\log(\text{O/H})$. At _low_ masses ($M_* \lesssim10^{10} M_\odot$), metallicity drops sharply with increasing SFR (strong anti-correlation), whereas at _high_ masses ($\gtrsim10^{11} M_\odot$), metallicity saturates and shows little dependence on SFR. Intriguingly, Mannucci et al. found that **high-redshift galaxies (up to $z\approx2.5$) lie on the _same_ $M_*{\rm -}Z{\rm -}\mathrm{SFR}$ surface defined by SDSS galaxies**, with no significant offset. This implied that the FMR might be _universal_, with the evolution of the _observed_ MZR over time simply due to higher-SFR (thus lower-$Z$) galaxies being common at earlier epochs rather than any change in the underlying relation. They introduced a parameter $\mu_{0.32} = \log M_* - 0.32\log\mathrm{SFR}$ which collapses this surface into a tight 2D projection; remarkably, galaxies from $z=0$ to $z\sim2.5$ all followed the same $\mu_{0.32}$–$Z$ relation with no evolution in metallicity for a given $\mu$. Only beyond $z>2.5$ did they see evidence of deviation (galaxies at $z\sim3-4$ being $\sim0.6$ dex more metal-poor). Mannucci et al. interpreted the FMR as the outcome of **two key mechanisms**: (1) infall of metal-poor gas, which dilutes metallicity and boosts SFR (dominant in low-mass, high-SFR systems and at high-$z$), and (2) metal-rich outflows that preferentially remove metals from shallow potential wells (dominant in massive or low-SFR systems). The combination of gas inflows and outflows, regulated by the Kennicutt–Schmidt law of star formation, can explain the shape of the FMR and the particular coefficient (0.32) needed in $\mu$. Notably, the very small scatter of the FMR (only ~12% in $Z$) was seen as evidence that galaxies acquire fuel via a **smooth accretion** process (continuous “cosmic drizzle” of gas), rather than sporadic starburst events, in order to stay so close to equilibrium.

Around the same time, **Lara-López et al. (2010)** similarly reported a “**fundamental plane**” for star-forming galaxies, relating stellar mass, gas metallicity, and SFR. Using SDSS and UV data, they fit a planar relation of the form $Z = Z(M_*, \mathrm{SFR})$ and found it reduced scatter compared to the MZR alone. This was effectively the same phenomenon as the FMR. Thus, by 2010 it became clear that the **MZR has a secondary dependence on SFR** – galaxies with higher current star formation are offset to lower metallicities.

**Over the past decade, extensive work has refined and scrutinized the FMR.** On the observational side, many studies have confirmed the existence of the $M_*$–SFR–$Z$ relation in the local Universe and explored it at higher redshifts:

-   _Calibration and methodology:_ Because metallicity measurement can depend on the calibration method (strong emission-line ratios vs. direct $T_e$ method), researchers revisited the FMR using consistent abundance scales. For example, **Curti et al. (2020)** re-derived the local MZR and FMR using a homogeneous **$T_e$-anchored scale** (tying strong-line diagnostics to the electron-temperature method) for $\sim$~200,000 SDSS galaxies. They confirmed that a clear anti-correlation between SFR and $Z$ persists: at fixed $M_*$, galaxies with especially high SFR show significantly lower metallicity, with the effect being most pronounced in extreme starburst systems. By explicitly allowing the turnover mass of the MZR to vary with SFR, Curti et al. achieved an even tighter FMR parameterization, reducing the metallicity scatter to only 0.054 dex. This reinforced that the FMR is a real physical relation, not an artifact of biased calibrations. (Notably, earlier works like Andrews & Martini 2013 had measured the MZR with stacked spectra using the direct method; they found a steeper MZR slope and suggested the SFR dependence might be somewhat weaker with direct-$T_e$ abundances, but the overall trend still qualitatively agreed that high-sSFR systems are metal-poor.) Recent analyses therefore provide a robust local benchmark for the FMR on an absolute abundance scale, to which high-$z$ studies can be compared.
    
-   _High-redshift tests:_ A key question has been whether the FMR truly does **not evolve** with redshift (as Mannucci et al. claimed up to $z\sim2.5$) or if there are subtle changes. Many high-$z$ surveys (e.g. using lensed galaxies, or deep spectroscopy from Keck/MOSFIRE and VLT) have examined whether their galaxies fall on the local FMR. For instance, studies of star-forming galaxies at $z\sim2$ (near the peak of cosmic star formation) often found that while the _qualitative_ dependence (higher SFR → lower $Z$ at fixed mass) holds, there may be a slight offset: high-$z$ galaxies tend to be a bit more metal-poor than the $z=0$ FMR would predict, at the highest masses or SFRs. However, these differences are small. **Cresci et al. (2019)** specifically revisited this issue by combining integral-field spectroscopy data for local galaxies (CALIFA and MaNGA surveys) and data for galaxies up to $z\approx2.3$. They addressed claims by earlier authors who questioned the FMR – for example, some IFU studies initially reported no significant SFR–$Z$ dependence locally. Cresci et al. showed that those conclusions arose from limited dynamic range and sample selection; when re-analyzed, the CALIFA and MaNGA samples _do_ show the expected metallicity decrease at higher SFR for a given $M_*$, consistent with the FMR. Furthermore, they found that all the high-$z$ datasets they examined are _compatible_ with the local SDSS-defined FMR, once observational uncertainties are accounted for. In other words, up to $z\sim2.3$ there is **no clear evolution** of the FMR within the errors – high-redshift galaxies occupy the same locus in $(M_*,\mathrm{SFR},Z)$ space as local galaxies. This reinforces the idea that the FMR may represent an equilibrium condition for star-forming galaxies, set by fundamental physics (gas supply and feedback) that hasn’t dramatically changed since early cosmic times. (At even higher redshifts $z>3$, some evolution likely occurs as galaxies begin to diverge due to very intense accretion, but those regimes are still being explored with new JWST data.)
    
-   *Physical drivers – gas content:* Perhaps the most important development in FMR studies has been understanding its physical **origin**. The anti-correlation of SFR and $Z$ hints that **gas supply** is the controlling factor: a galaxy actively forming stars at high rate likely has an abundant gas reservoir (and/or recent inflow), which both fuels star formation and dilutes the ISM metals. Conversely, a galaxy with low gas content will have low SFR and higher metal concentration (since metals accumulated but little dilution). This led researchers to investigate relations involving **gas mass or gas fraction** explicitly. Indeed, a number of works found an even tighter link between metallicity and gas fraction. **Bothwell et al. (2013)** used H I 21cm data from the ALFALFA survey to show that at fixed stellar mass, galaxies with larger H I gas reservoirs have systematically lower metallicities. In fact, they demonstrated that one can reduce the scatter in the MZR **almost as much by adding H I mass as by adding SFR** as the second parameter. In their sample, incorporating atomic gas mass lowered the scatter to $\sim0.075$ dex (comparable to the SFR-based FMR’s 0.073 dex). This suggests that the **“fundamental” relation is essentially one between stellar mass, metal content, and **gas content** (since SFR is related to gas availability). Subsequent studies extended this idea: **Hughes et al. (2013)** and **Brown et al. (2018)**, using H I and CO surveys (xGASS and xCOLD GASS), confirmed that **gas fraction is strongly anti-correlated with metallicity at fixed $M_\*$** accreted gas (e,to the scatter in the). Notably, Brown et al. found this gas–$Z$ correlation to be **stronger** than the direct SFR–$Z$ correlation, regardless of which metallicity calibration was used accreted gas (e,to the scatter in the). In other words, if you control for how much gas a galaxy has, the current SFR adds little additional information about its metallicity. This makes intuitive sense: the more gas-rich a galaxy, the more dilute its ISM tends to be (lower $Z$) and the higher its potential SFR (more fuel). Thus, fluctuations in a galaxy’s **gas accretion rate** (adding metal-poor gas) can explain the scatter in the MZR better than fluctuations in outflow or other processes. These results support a picture in which **inflows of fresh gas are the primary driver** of the FMR: a surge of accretion causes both a spike in star formation and a dip in metallicity (due to dilution), moving a galaxy to the high-SFR, low-Z corner of the FMR. Over time, star formation uses up the gas and enriches it, bringing the galaxy back up in metallicity. This cycle can repeat, producing the *scatter* around the average relation. The tightness of the FMR implies these cycles are not too large in amplitude for most normal star-forming disks (they stay near equilibrium). Moreover, cosmological simulations find consistent behavior – e.g. the EAGLE simulation showed that the **atomic gas fraction, $M_\*$, and SFR define a fundamental plane** accounting for most variance in galaxy properties, arising naturally from self-regulation,(2019). Similarly, IllustrisTNG simulations (Torrey et al. 2019) found that galaxies oscillate between “**gas-rich, accretion-dominated**” phases (lower $Z$ at fixed mass) and “**gas-poor, enrichment-dominated**” phases (higher $Z$), which exactly mirrors the FMR phenomenology.
    
-   _Extensions and variations:_ Researchers have also explored variants of the FMR by including other components or tracers. One extension has been to examine a **“stellar FMR”** – analogous relations involving the **stellar metallicity** of a galaxy’s stars rather than the gas-phase metallicity. Only recently, with large IFU surveys, have reliable measurements of _light-weighted stellar metallicities_ across wide samples become available. **Looser et al. (2023/24)** analyzed MaNGA survey galaxies and found a clear trend in stellar metallicity ($Z_*$) that echoes the gas FMR. At a given stellar mass, **galaxies that lie _above_ the SF main sequence (star-bursting systems) have _lower_ stellar metallicities than those on or below the sequence**. Conversely, more quiescent galaxies (below the main sequence) have higher average $Z_*$, suggesting they accumulated more metals in their stars. This “**stellar FMR**” indicates that as galaxies exhaust or cut off their gas inflow (a process known as **starvation** or strangulation), they continue forming stars from previously enriched gas, thereby raising the metallicity of their stellar populations. The correlation persists even when considering only the _recently formed_ stars (those younger than 300 Myr), implying that the gas-phase FMR is continuously imprinted onto the stars over cosmic time. Looser et al. interpret this as evidence that **removing or reducing gas inflow (starvation)** is a primary mechanism by which galaxies quench: without new metal-poor gas, star formation slows and the existing gas becomes more metal-rich, which gets reflected in the next generations of stars. This is consistent with the regulator model expectation that cutting off inflow (e.g. in cluster environments like Virgo) causes a galaxy to drift toward lower SFR and higher metallicity – a path observed in both gas and stars. Another variant of the FMR involves **molecular gas**: some studies have looked at a 4D space of $M_*$–SFR–metallicity–H$_2$ mass (or even a fundamental plane of _three_ variables among these four). While molecular data are more limited, the general finding is again that at fixed $M_*$, gas-rich galaxies (high H$_2$/$M_*$) are more metal-poor, reinforcing that gas fraction is the underlying third parameter (often termed the “fundamental **gas**-metallicity relation”).
    

In summary, years of observational work have solidified the FMR as a cornerstone empirical relation for star-forming galaxies. It ties together a galaxy’s current star formation activity with its metal enrichment status, in a way that aligns with theoretical expectations from the self-regulated growth of galaxies. The FMR appears to hold across a huge range of galaxy mass (dwarfs to massive spirals) and out to at least mid-level redshifts ($z\sim2$) for disks, though extreme systems (very low-mass dwarfs, or very high-$z$ galaxies) can exhibit deviations. Importantly, **late-type disk galaxies** dominate these samples, but even **dwarf irregulars** follow the trend (often sitting at the low-$M_*$, high-sSFR, low-$Z$ end), and **ellipticals** (being mostly quenched) would lie off the star-forming FMR by definition due to near-zero SFR. The existence of the FMR has prompted a revision of simple galaxy evolution models and provided a quantitative benchmark for simulations: any successful galaxy formation model should reproduce the MZR _and_ its SFR (or gas fraction) dependence. Thanks to the FMR, observers now recognize that **the scatter in the mass–metallicity relation is not random but highly informative**, tracing the physical state of a galaxy’s gas supply.

## Related Relationships: SF Main Sequence, MZR, and SFR–Metallicity Trends (Global and Resolved)

The Fundamental Metallicity Relation does not exist in isolation – it connects to other “byproduct” scaling relations that have been long studied. Here we briefly review those key relations and how they interrelate, noting especially results from **spatially resolved** observations in nearby disk galaxies (which provide a more nuanced view inside galaxies like those in the Virgo Cluster).

-   **Star-Forming Main Sequence (SFMS):** This is the tight correlation between a galaxy’s stellar mass and its SFR for star-forming galaxies. Locally at $z\sim0$, it is approximately linear (slope $\sim0.7$–1) over many decades in mass, with a scatter of ~0.3 dex in SFR. Physically, the SFMS reflects that more massive galaxies tend to have higher absolute star formation rates, likely because they have larger gas reservoirs. The self-regulation model naturally reproduces this: a galaxy’s inflow rate (linked to halo mass) sets its SFR, giving $\text{SFR}\propto M_*$ to first order. At higher redshifts, the SFMS persists but with an elevated normalization (galaxies of a given $M_*$ had higher SFR in the past). Because the SFMS is so tight, astronomers often define “distance from the main sequence” as a metric of starburstiness or quiescence. In the **resolved** sense, we now see a similar trend locally: within galaxy disks, regions of higher stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_*$) form stars at higher surface densities ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). This **resolved SFMS** means that on kpc scales, star formation activity correlates with the local availability of stellar mass (which often traces gas availability). For example, Sánchez et al. (2013) and Cano-Díaz et al. (2016) found that spaxels in star-forming galaxies follow a local $\Sigma_*$–$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation analogous to the global SFMS. This suggests that the global behavior is rooted in local physics: each patch of a galactic disk is converting gas to stars following a similar efficiency law, modulated by local conditions.
    
-   **Mass–Metallicity Relation (MZR):** First noted in the 1970s, this is the tendency of more massive (or luminous) galaxies to have higher gas-phase metallicities. In the local universe, the MZR is well-characterized by data from SDSS: metallicity rises with $M_*$, steeply from dwarfs up to $M_* \sim10^{10.5} M_\odot$, then flattening toward a plateau at the high-mass end (around solar metallicity ~8.7–9.0 in 12+log(O/H)). Tremonti et al. (2004) attributed the MZR shape to efficient metal loss via outflows in low-mass galaxies (they cannot retain metals, so low $Z$), whereas high-mass galaxies retain metals and reach yield-limited saturation. The MZR evolves with time: at higher redshift, galaxies of a given mass are systematically more metal-poor (e.g. at $z\sim2$, a $10^{10} M_\odot$ galaxy is ~0.3 dex lower in O/H than its $z=0$ counterpart). Traditionally, this was explained by ideas like **downsizing** (lower-mass systems complete their star formation later, so at earlier times they were less enriched) or stronger outflows in the past. The advent of the FMR reframed this: much of the apparent MZR evolution is a consequence of the SFR dependence. Early-universe galaxies had higher SFRs, thus lower metallicities at fixed mass, aligning with the same FMR surface. Nonetheless, environment and galaxy type can introduce _scatter_ in the MZR. For example, galaxies in denser environments (groups/clusters) may show slightly higher metallicities at fixed mass due to **strangulation** (cessation of inflow). Observations comparing cluster vs. field galaxies have sometimes found a modest metallicity enhancement (on order 0.05 dex) in cluster members, consistent with the idea that deprived of fresh gas, cluster galaxies gradually enrich their remaining gas. (Though some studies find minimal environmental MZR difference, likely depending on the stage of infall or the presence of gas removal processes like ram-pressure stripping in clusters like Virgo.) In any case, the MZR can be understood as a projection of the regulator equilibrium: it’s essentially the condition where inflow, outflow, and star formation have balanced such that lower-mass systems (with deeper potential wells) end up at lower equilibrium metallicities for given yields and loss fractions. The MZR is also observed in **stellar metallicities** of galaxies (massive galaxies have older stars with higher [$Z_*/$H], reflecting the same trend imprinted over their history).
    
    In **resolved** studies, a local form of the mass–metallicity relation is seen when using _surface mass density_. Within a disk galaxy, regions of higher $\Sigma_*$ tend to have higher gas-phase O/H. **Barrera-Ballesteros et al. (2016)**, using $\sim$650 MaNGA galaxies, presented this as a tight **$\Sigma_*–Z$ relation** spanning 3 orders of magnitude in $\Sigma_*$. This local relation holds within individual galaxies (from inner bulge to outer disk) and is remarkably uniform across different galaxies. They found that the **global** MZR and even radial metallicity gradients are natural outcomes of this local $\Sigma_*$–$Z$ law. Essentially, each galaxy’s metallicity at a given radius is primarily set by the local gravity (as traced by $\Sigma_*$), rather than global properties. They also noted that the $\Sigma_*–Z$ relation is largely **independent of the galaxy’s total mass or SFR**, except in extreme cases (very low-mass, high-sSFR galaxies showed slight offsets). This implies that in present-day disk galaxies, **local conditions dominate metal enrichment:** e.g. a high-density region in a small galaxy can reach similar metallicity as a region of comparable density in a large galaxy. Global differences (like a dwarf overall having lower $Z$ than a massive spiral) simply arise because dwarfs have most of their mass in low-density outer regions, whereas massive spirals have extensive high-$\Sigma_*$ inner regions. This resolved perspective emphasizes that **metallicity is a local equilibrium phenomenon** – governed by local gas supply versus star formation – reinforcing the self-regulation idea on sub-galactic scales.
    
-   **SFR–Metallicity Anti-Correlation (and Resolved Variations):** By “SFR–metallicity relationship,” we refer to the inverse correlation between a galaxy’s star formation activity and its metal abundance, the same essence captured by the FMR. Globally, at fixed mass this is an anti-correlation (higher SFR → lower $Z$). There isn’t a simple two-variable law (since mass is the third parameter), but one can imagine slicing the FMR at constant $M_*$ to see $Z$ vs. SFR, which is a negative slope. This trend has been observed directly in various samples: e.g., Ellison et al. (2008) first noted that SDSS galaxies with high sSFR had lower metallicities than typical, and conversely quiescent star-forming galaxies were slightly more metal-rich – an early hint of the FMR. The interpretation, now confirmed, is that **episodic inflows of metal-poor gas trigger high SFRs and dilute the ISM metals**, causing those galaxies to deviate to low $Z$. As star formation proceeds, metals build up again and SFR may drop, bringing the galaxy back up in $Z$. This seesaw ensures an anti-correlation. **Brown et al. (2018)** explicitly showed that galaxies with unusually high gas content (and thus high SFR for their mass) exhibit significantly **depressed metallicities**, consistent with recent gas accretion events. They argued that _gas accretion_ is the principal cause of these metallicity dips, rather than, say, metal-rich outflows, because one sees the strongest effect in systems with high gas fractions (which wouldn’t be the case if outflows dominating – outflows would also lower gas content). This SFR–$Z$ anti-correlation is essentially a different view of the FMR and has no meaning without specifying mass. However, in a resolved context we can also ask: within a single galaxy, do regions of higher current star formation have lower metallicity? If the self-regulation applies locally, one might expect, for instance, H II regions actively forming stars could have slightly lower abundances if they are associated with recent inflow or mixing of gas. Some resolved studies have indeed found **negative correlations between local SFR density and local metallicity** – dubbed a “resolved FMR.” For example, **Belfiore et al. (2017)** using MaNGA data reported that, at fixed local stellar surface density, spaxels with higher star formation (Hα emission) show marginally lower oxygen abundance (on average). This means that within a galaxy disk, regions experiencing a star-forming boost tend to be a bit metal-deficient compared to the rest of the disk’s baseline gradient. Direct evidence of this happens in starbursting regions: e.g., the centers of some barred galaxies undergo starbursts and show a noticeable drop in metallicity (a **central dilution**), likely due to inflow of metal-poor gas driven by the bar or interactions. Resolved studies by Sánchez et al. and others find that while the **$\Sigma_*–Z$ relation dominates locally**, there is a **secondary inverse dependence on recent SFR** (traced by Hα EW or surface brightness) such that high local SFR can lower the metallicity slightly. This aligns with the global FMR in miniature. Still, the effect is subtle in normal disks – typically a few hundredths of a dex variation – because metal mixing is efficient on small scales and the local gas reservoir may be quickly enriched by massive star feedback. Nonetheless, these trends have been detected: for instance, regions of galaxies lying above the galaxy’s average SFMS (star-forming clumps) often have flatter or lowered metallicity locally, hinting at recent gas inflow fueling those clumps. This is an active area of research using IFU surveys (CALIFA, MaNGA, SAMI), sometimes yielding seemingly contradictory results (some authors initially saw no local SFR–$Z$ effect), but consensus is emerging that a weak resolved FMR exists in disks, consistent with the global picture.
    

In practical terms, all these relationships – SFMS, MZR, SFR–$Z$ anti-correlation – are interlinked manifestations of how galaxies acquire and use gas. The **self-regulation model** provides a unifying explanation: galaxies strive for a balanced state where their star formation rate is set by gas inflow, and their metallicity by the ratio of metal production to gas accretion/outflow. The **Fundamental Metallicity Relation** is essentially a statement of this equilibrium: $Z$ is higher when the system is more “closed-box” (low inflow or high past star formation relative to gas) and lower when the system is “open” (high inflow relative to star formation). Disk galaxies at $z\sim0$ (like those in Virgo) nicely obey these trends; they lie on the FMR and have internal gradients consistent with local regulation. Dwarf galaxies, which have lower metallicities, fit in as systems with higher effective inflow or wind loss (they populate the low-mass, high-sSFR end of the FMR). Early-type galaxies (ellipticals), although not forming stars now, were likely on the FMR when they did form stars; after quenching, they simply move off in SFR but retain high metallicities from their last burst of star formation (hence high stellar $Z$).

## Further Connections and Emerging Frontiers

Looking beyond the core topics above, several related fields of study intersect with the FMR and self-regulation theme:

-   **Galaxy Simulations and Chemical Evolution Models:** Modern hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, FIRE, etc.) and semi-analytic models now routinely track stellar mass growth, gas flows, and metallicity simultaneously. A major test for these models is to reproduce the observed MZR and FMR at $z=0$ and their evolution. Early models struggled to get the normalization and slope of the MZR right, often due to overly efficient early star formation or feedback issues. Recent models with improved feedback and gas recycling show much better agreement. They also explicitly find that **stochastic gas accretion drives the scatter** in these relations. For example, Lagos et al. (2016) found in EAGLE that the principal components of variation in star-forming galaxies were stellar mass, gas content, and SFR – essentially identifying a model FMR driven by gas fraction. Yates et al. (2012) used semi-analytic models to examine the SFR dependence of $Z$ and found a qualitatively similar trend to observations, even noting a reversal of the SFR–$Z$ slope at very high masses (which had been hinted at in SDSS data as well: the most massive galaxies show _higher_ $Z$ at higher SFR, possibly due to AGN feedback quenching the low-SFR systems). Simulations also allow “turning off” certain processes to see their impact on the FMR scatter: e.g. some studies confirm that without inflow fluctuations the FMR would largely disappear, whereas variations in feedback and winds contribute more to _vertical_ scatter (changing all galaxies’ Z uniformly) rather than the SFR-dependent _tilt_. Thus, theory strongly backs the interpretation that the FMR is evidence of **self-regulation via inflows/outflows**.
    
-   **Atomic vs. Molecular Gas Role:** Different types of galaxies might show different behavior in the FMR depending on their gas phase. For instance, the so-called **HI-dominated galaxies** (dwarf irregulars or HI-rich spirals) often lie off the standard SFMS (forming stars inefficiently) and can show low metallicities for their mass. These are sometimes termed “HI-excess” or “HI-extreme” galaxies. Recent work (e.g. Bothwell 2016; Huang et al. 2012) indicates that such gas-rich galaxies follow a continuous sequence where metallicity correlates with the _molecular-to-atomic gas ratio_. Essentially, converting atomic gas to molecules (which then form stars) is a step that impacts metallicity: galaxies that are inefficient at forming H$_2$ (staying HI-rich) tend to have lower metallicities (and lower SFR). In the **Virgo Cluster**, environmental processes can strip atomic gas (HI) from spirals, which could cause a galaxy to temporarily move on the FMR (likely by lowering its SFR at fixed mass and perhaps raising its metallicity since remaining gas is centrally concentrated and enriched). These multi-phase gas considerations add complexity but also potentially explain outliers.
    
-   **Resolved Metallicity Gradients and Gas Flows:** A “byproduct” of the FMR and self-regulation is how galaxies establish their internal metallicity gradients. In spiral disks, metallicity usually declines with radius (the outskirts are more metal-poor). This can be viewed as each radius in the disk having its own equilibrium with slower enrichment far out (due to lower $\Sigma_*$ and perhaps more accretion of fresh gas). If a galaxy accretes a lot of metal-poor gas, it may first dilute the outer regions (steepening the gradient) or radial inflows might distribute it. **Chemical evolution by radius** is a rich field: for example, we see in some cases “flattened” metallicity gradients in the outer disks, possibly due to metal mixing or past gas accretion. In clusters, stripped galaxies (like Virgo spirals undergoing ram-pressure stripping) can show **metallicity _gradients_ that are unusually flat or inverted** in the outer parts, as metal-rich gas from the center gets pushed out or low-Z gas falls in. These detailed spatial studies complement the global FMR by highlighting the importance of **gas flows within galaxies** – inflow, outflow, and mixing can vary with radius and time. They still, however, generally obey the overarching principle of self-regulation locally.
    
-   **Starburst and Post-starburst Galaxies:** Extreme systems provide interesting tests. **Starburst galaxies** (e.g. luminous infrared galaxies or Green Pea galaxies) often deviate more strongly – they show very high SFR and indeed very low metallicities for their mass, consistent with a big inflow event. Some Green Pea galaxies (compact high-sSFR dwarfs) have metallicities far below the usual MZR, essentially occupying the extreme edge of the FMR. They might be local analogs of early-universe galaxies. Studying them helps pin down how far the FMR can be extrapolated. On the other side, **post-starburst** or quenched galaxies (with little current SFR) typically sit above the FMR (they have relatively high metallicities for their mass, because they enriched their gas in the past but are not diluting it now). These outliers support the notion: shut off star formation (and thus shut off dilution), and metallicity spikes upward – exactly as expected if inflow has ceased (starvation). Indeed, Peng et al. (2015) argued that strangulation (cutting off gas inflow) is the primary cause of quenching in satellites, because it explains why quenched galaxies have higher stellar metallicities than still-star-forming ones at the same mass. This is fully consistent with the gas-phase FMR framework over the long term.
    

In conclusion, focusing on **low-redshift, star-forming disk galaxies**, we see that the self-regulating “bathtub” equilibrium provides a compelling big-picture understanding: it naturally produces the **Fundamental Metallicity Relation** linking stellar mass, star formation, and metallicity. Observationally, the FMR has been mapped out from dwarfs to massive spirals in the local Universe and holds (with minor tweaks) even at high redshifts – indicating a universal balance between gas fueling and star formation. Variants like the inclusion of gas content (sometimes called an **HI-FMR**) reinforce that it is the **gas supply** that underlies the FMR. Moreover, spatially resolved data in nearby galaxies (e.g. Virgo Cluster spirals) show that these relations are at work on small scales too, with local stellar density driving metallicity and local star-forming patches showing dilution during starbursts. As we continue to explore these topics with new surveys and simulations, the synergy of the self-regulation model and empirical relations like the FMR will remain crucial for deciphering how galaxies form stars and produce metals in a cosmological context.
