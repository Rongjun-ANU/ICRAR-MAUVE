Here is  a literature review on the Mass–Metallicity Relation (MZR), covering its origin, development in the local universe, and spatially resolved (rMZR) aspects with emphasis on IFU survey results (e.g., CALIFA, MaNGA, PHANGS, SAMI). I also incorporate its connection to the self-regulated galaxy evolution framework, while briefly mentioning its cosmic evolution and stellar vs. gas-phase metallicity variations.

# Mass–Metallicity Relation (MZR) – Literature Review

## Historical Origins of the MZR

The idea that more massive galaxies are more chemically enriched has roots dating back over half a century. In elliptical galaxies, a correlation between luminosity (as a proxy for stellar mass) and stellar metallicity was noted as early as the 1960s. However, the first clear evidence for a mass–metallicity relation (MZR) in star-forming systems came from **Lequeux et al. (1979)**. Studying irregular and blue compact dwarf galaxies, Lequeux and colleagues found that galaxies with higher total mass (or rotation velocity) tend to have higher gas-phase heavy element abundances. This pioneering work set the stage for subsequent research, establishing that galaxy mass and chemical enrichment are fundamentally linked. The early theoretical interpretation, proposed by Larson (1974), was that low-mass galaxies are unable to retain supernova ejecta – vigorous galactic winds in shallow potential wells drive out metals – whereas massive galaxies retain more of their metals, naturally explaining the emerging MZR trend. This insight foreshadowed later models in which galactic outflows play a central role in setting metallicity.

## Establishment in the Local Universe

Through the 1980s and 1990s, numerous studies solidified the MZR across different galaxy samples. Researchers observed that gas-phase oxygen abundance correlates strongly with galaxy luminosity or mass in both dwarf and normal galaxies (e.g. Skillman et al. 1989; Zaritsky et al. 1994). A watershed moment came with **Tremonti et al. (2004)**, who analyzed over 50,000 star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Tremonti et al. confirmed a tight stellar mass vs. gas metallicity relation in the local universe with high statistical significance. The MZR at *z* ~ 0 is steep at low masses and flattens toward a metallicity “saturation” at high stellar masses (above *M*** ≈ 10^10–10^11 M*⊙), indicating that massive galaxies reach an enrichment plateau. The scatter in the local MZR is relatively small (on the order of ~0.1 dex in O/H), suggesting a fundamental relation. Indeed, it was shown that galaxy stellar mass is a more fundamental parameter for metallicity than luminosity, since luminosity can be affected by recent star formation. Over the past two decades, this relation has been repeatedly verified with different samples and metallicity calibration methods. While different strong-line calibration scales yield slightly different absolute abundances, they consistently produce a similar MZR shape (a monotonic increase of O/H with mass, asymptoting at high mass). Some studies in the late 2000s explored whether secondary parameters could further reduce the scatter in the MZR. In particular, a tentative dependence on star formation rate (SFR) was reported, leading to the proposal of a so-called “fundamental metallicity relation” linking mass, metallicity, and SFR. We note this connection for completeness: incorporating SFR as a third axis defines a surface in the M–Z–SFR space (the FMR). However, we will not delve into the FMR here, and indeed later integral-field spectroscopic surveys found any SFR influence on metallicity to be weak or confined to extreme galaxies.

## Evolution over Cosmic Time

Crucially, the MZR is not static but evolves with cosmic time. Galaxies in the early universe were generally less enriched, so the MZR at higher redshift is offset to lower metallicities at a given mass. For example, **Erb et al. (2006)** found that star-forming galaxies at *z* ~ 2 have typical oxygen abundances about 0.3 dex lower than local galaxies of the same stellar mass. Similarly, **Maiolino et al. (2008)** probed *z* ~ 3–4 and reported an even stronger downward shift in the MZR, reflecting the cosmos at an earlier stage of metal buildup. Many intermediate-redshift surveys (e.g. SAVAGLIO 2005 at *z* ~ 0.7, and others) confirmed this general trend: as one looks back in time, galaxies of a given mass are more metal-poor. The MZR’s zero-point therefore increases over time, tracking the overall chemical enrichment of the universe. By *z* ~ 0, galaxies have attained significantly higher metallicities. Quantitatively, the MZR normalization evolves by roughly ~0.1–0.3 dex from *z* ~ 1–2 to now, depending on mass range. However, the *slope* of the relation appears to remain similar, at least out to *z* ~2, implying that the same physical processes govern the mass-metallicity scaling across epochs, just starting from lower baseline abundances at earlier times. With new James Webb Space Telescope data, the MZR has now been measured out to *z* > 5–8 for low-mass galaxies, and even at those early times a correlation between mass and metallicity seems to persist – though its exact form and any potential break-down at the highest redshifts are active areas of research.

## Gas-Phase vs. Stellar MZR Variations

It is important to clarify that “metallicity” in galaxies can refer to different components. The classic MZR discussed above is defined for gas-phase metallicity (typically the oxygen abundance in H II regions). A closely related but distinct relation exists for **stellar metallicities** – the average heavy element content of a galaxy’s stellar population. Massive galaxies not only have metal-rich gas, but also host more metal-rich stars on average. **Gallazzi et al. (2005)**, for instance, analyzed ~170,000 SDSS galaxies and found a clear stellar mass–stellar metallicity relation: higher-mass galaxies have significantly higher mean stellar [Fe/H] than lower-mass galaxies. This stellar MZR reflects the integrated star formation and chemical enrichment history: low-mass galaxies tend to form fewer metals and/or lose more of them over time, yielding metal-poor stars, whereas high-mass galaxies efficiently enrich their interstellar medium, producing generations of metal-rich stars. Remarkably, the stellar MZR extends to the dwarf galaxy regime as well. **Kirby et al. (2013)** measured individual red giant star abundances in Local Group dwarf galaxies and showed that dwarfs lie on the same mass–metallicity sequence as larger galaxies, following a continuous relation in stellar metallicity over five orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Thus, whether one considers gas or stars, more massive galaxies are more enriched – although the gas-phase MZR can at any given time be influenced by ongoing inflows/outflows, whereas the stellar MZR records a time-integrated past enrichment.

## Resolved MZR Within Galaxies

In the past decade, integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopic surveys have allowed the exploration of *spatially-resolved* mass–metallicity relations inside galaxies. Instead of a single metallicity per galaxy, IFU data (from surveys like CALIFA, MaNGA, SAMI, and PHANGS-MUSE) provide maps of stellar mass density and gas metallicity across galaxy disks. These studies have revealed a **resolved MZR (rMZR)**: on *local* scales, regions of higher stellar mass surface density (or higher local stellar mass) tend to exhibit higher gas-phase metallicity. For example, using CALIFA data, Sánchez et al. (2013) showed that across ∼3000 H II regions in 150 galaxies, there is a tight correlation between local stellar mass surface density and local oxygen abundance. Similarly, **Barrera-Ballesteros et al. (2016)** analyzed over 500,000 spaxels from 653 MaNGA galaxies, finding a strong Σ_*–Z relation spanning three decades in surface density and a factor of ~4 in O/H. In these disk galaxies, metallicity increases smoothly from the outer low-density regions to the inner high-density regions, mirroring the global trend but on kpc scales. Notably, the resolved MZR can simultaneously explain two key observables: (1) the global galaxy MZR (since the galaxy’s integrated metallicity is effectively an average of its locally governed values), and (2) the existence of radial metallicity gradients in disks. Regions in the outskirts have both lower stellar density and lower metallicity, while inner regions are denser and more metal-rich – consistent with an “inside-out” enrichment pattern. Furthermore, the local MZR appears to be relatively insensitive to a galaxy’s total mass or star formation rate, except at extremes. In other words, even a low-mass galaxy follows the same Σ_*–Z locus as a high-mass galaxy (just sampling a lower range of surface densities). This suggests that local conditions, such as the ability of a given region to retain metals, are paramount in setting metallicity. IFU surveys like SAMI and MaNGA have also reaffirmed that any secondary effect of SFR on the local metallicity is minimal – consistent with the idea that the MZR (globally and locally) is governed primarily by mass (gravity) and the processes of metal retention or loss. The resolved perspective has enriched our understanding by showing that *within* galaxies, the same physical principles that give rise to a global MZR are at work on smaller scales.

## Theoretical Interpretations and Self-Regulation

What drives the MZR? The consensus is that the MZR reflects the balance of a galaxy’s “metal cycle” – the production of metals by stars, inflow of fresh gas, and outflow of metal-enriched gas. In simple closed-box models (where a galaxy evolves without significant inflows or outflows), one would expect a relationship between final metallicity and the fraction of gas converted to stars. However, real galaxies exchange material with their surroundings, and this appears crucial for explaining the MZR’s shape and evolution. **Galactic outflows (supernova/stellar winds)** are often cited as a primary factor: lower-mass galaxies have weaker gravitational potential wells, so a larger fraction of the metals they produce can escape in winds. This leaves the remaining gas metal-poor. By contrast, massive galaxies can better retain their metal-enriched ejecta, allowing their interstellar medium to reach higher abundances. This “galactic fountain” picture, first suggested by Larson and others, qualitatively explains the trend. Modern cosmological simulations likewise find that implementing mass-dependent wind “mass loading” (strong winds in dwarfs, weaker in massive galaxies) naturally reproduces an MZR.

Beyond outflows, **gas inflows (accretion)** and the efficiency of star formation also play roles in a more holistic “self-regulation” model. In recent years the **“bathtub” or gas-regulator model** has provided a unifying theoretical framework. In this picture, galaxies tend toward an equilibrium where the inflow of fresh gas, the star formation rate, and the outflow of gas adjust such that the system maintains a nearly steady gas mass and metallicity over time. If a galaxy is too metal-poor for its mass, it means it has recently accreted metal-poor gas or ejected metals; star formation will then convert some of that gas into metals until a new equilibrium is reached. Conversely, if a galaxy is overly metal-rich, metal-loaded outflows or dilution by inflow will bring it back in line. The result of this balance is an MZR where metallicity rises with mass until outflows become ineffective. In equilibrium models (e.g. the analytical formulation by **Lilly et al. 2013**), the metallicity is given by the ratio of the metal yield to the effective gas inflow rate, which scales with galaxy mass – higher mass galaxies have lower relative outflow rates and typically higher star-formation efficiencies, boosting their metallicity. In effect, the MZR can be seen as a natural outcome of galaxies regulating themselves: a **“feedback loop”** where star formation and feedback (supernovae) adjust the gas content and metallicity toward a mass-dependent equilibrium. This is supported by observations that late-type galaxies today appear to be in a quasi-steady state, with gas recycling timescales much shorter than cosmic inflow timescales. The shallow scatter in the MZR is a clue that many galaxies are indeed in such a balanced state. Other factors may impart second-order variations – for instance, galaxy size or gas fraction might affect metallicity at a given mass (compact galaxies can retain metals more efficiently, and high gas fraction systems dilute their metals). But by and large, the dominant driver of the MZR is the **competition between gravity-driven retention of metals and feedback-driven loss of metals**, operating within the cosmic supply of gas. In summary, the MZR’s origin and evolution are best understood in the context of galaxy self-regulation: as galaxies grow in mass, their ability to retain and recycle the products of stellar nucleosynthesis improves, leading to a predictable rise in chemical abundance with mass – a relationship that has endured from the local universe to cosmic high noon and beyond.
