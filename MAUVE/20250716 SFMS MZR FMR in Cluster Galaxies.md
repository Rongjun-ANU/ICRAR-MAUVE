Here is a review on observational (and some theoretical) studies that examine how the cluster environment affects the star-forming main sequence (SFMS), mass–metallicity relation (MZR), and fundamental metallicity relation (FMR)—including both integrated and spatially-resolved analyses. The focus will be on low-redshift clusters (e.g. Virgo, Coma, Fornax). I also look for studies incorporating optical data, with extensions into other wavelengths (e.g. ALMA, HI) where relevant.

# Environmental Effects on Cluster Galaxies: SF Main Sequence, MZR, FMR, and Resolved Trends

## Star-Forming Main Sequence (SFMS) in Cluster Environments

**Local Universe (z ~ 0):** In nearby clusters, the star-forming main sequence (SFR–stellar mass relation) has a similar slope to the field relation, but with significantly greater scatter due to environmental quenching. For example, **Boselli et al. (2023)** used Hα data for 384 Virgo Cluster galaxies and found the SFMS slope in Virgo is comparable to that in the field, yet the dispersion is ~3× larger (≈1 dex). This increased scatter is driven by **HI-stripped cluster galaxies** that lie far below the normal SFMS (i.e. **suppressed SFR at fixed mass**), whereas Virgo galaxies with normal gas content still follow the usual sequence. The specific SFRs of gas-poor (HI-deficient) cluster spirals are much lower than those of HI-rich counterparts of the same mass, indicating many cluster members are in the process of **quenching**. Such observations strongly suggest **outside-in quenching by ram-pressure stripping (RPS)**: only a rapid stripping of outer gas (quenching star formation in <1 Gyr) can produce such a pronounced SFR deficit, whereas slower “starvation” alone would not yield the large scatter observed. Indeed, models tuned to include RPS can reproduce the wide SFMS scatter in Virgo, ruling out milder gas removal processes.

- *Quenched Fraction vs. SFMS:* A key environmental effect at low z is that a **higher fraction of galaxies are quenched** in clusters. Those **few that remain actively star-forming in cluster cores are often the recently infallen or less affected galaxies**, which still follow the SFMS similarly to field galaxies. Once a cluster galaxy’s gas is significantly stripped, its SFR drops and it falls off the SFMS, joining the “quenched” population. This dichotomy leads to the above-mentioned large dispersion: **HI-normal cluster galaxies continue forming stars normally, while HI-poor ones have reduced SFRs**. In phase–space diagrams (cluster-centric distance vs. velocity), galaxies with low SFR and gas content tend to be deep in the cluster potential, consistent with being accreted earlier and stripped, whereas recently infalling galaxies still on the SFMS reside at larger radii.

**Intermediate to High Redshift:** At earlier cosmic times, clusters had a less pronounced impact on the SFMS, reflecting the late onset of environmental quenching. **Nantais et al. (2020)** examined Hα-based SFRs in SpARCS clusters at *z* ~ 1.6 and found **no significant offset** in the SFR–M★ relation between cluster members and field galaxies – implying that, at *z* ≈ 1.6, cluster star-forming galaxies had **similar SFRs as field counterparts** for a given mass. This suggests environmental quenching was not yet widespread in those early clusters. By *z* ~ 1, subtle differences begin to emerge: the **GOGREEN survey** (11 clusters at *z* ~ 1.0–1.5) reported only a **“very modest” suppression of SFRs** in cluster galaxies compared to the field. Specifically, GOGREEN found the cluster SFMS to be shifted slightly downward in normalization (lower SFR at fixed M★) and a higher fraction of cluster galaxies lying below the main sequence, but the effect was small. This mild shift implies that **environmental effects were starting to quench some star formation by \*z\* ~1, but many cluster galaxies were still forming stars at near-field rates**.

**Key conclusion:** In summary, **low-redshift clusters show strong environmental quenching** – many satellites have lost gas and dropped off the SFMS – whereas **high-redshift clusters had much weaker effects on SFR**, with cluster galaxies’ SFMS closely resembling that of the field. The transition appears gradual: as the universe evolves, cluster processes (ram-pressure, etc.) progressively shut down star formation in satellites. Observationally, the main sequence in dense environments becomes depopulated from the high-SFR end and gains scatter due to partially quenched galaxies. Only those cluster spirals that have not experienced heavy gas stripping remain on the SFMS, while others are **relegated to the sub-main-sequence “quenched” regime**.

## Mass–Metallicity Relation (MZR) in Cluster Environments

**Local Clusters (z ~ 0):** Environment also imprints subtle signatures on the **mass–gas-phase metallicity relation**. Several studies using Sloan Digital Sky Survey data have found that **star-forming cluster galaxies tend to be slightly more metal-rich (higher O/H) than field galaxies of the same mass**, but the difference is small (on the order of a few hundredths of a dex). For example, **Ellison et al. (2009)** analyzed ~1,300 SDSS cluster star-forming galaxies and found their MZR is **shifted upward by ~0.04 dex in metallicity** relative to a mass-matched field control sample. This metal enhancement did **not** correlate strongly with cluster-scale properties like velocity dispersion or cluster mass. Instead, the **local galaxy density** was the driving factor: cluster galaxies in locally overdense regions (e.g. with close neighbors) showed ~0.05 dex higher median metallicity than those in sparse environments. Crucially, **field galaxies in equally high-density regions exhibited similar metallicity enhancements**, indicating the **MZR offset is due to environment (overdensity) rather than mere cluster membership**. In other words, a galaxy’s immediate environment (being a satellite with restricted gas supply or experiencing interactions) is what elevates its metallicity, consistent with processes like **strangulation** (cutting off infall of metal-poor gas). Indeed, **satellite galaxies** in the local universe are observed to have slightly higher O/H at fixed mass than centrals, especially at lower masses, with differences on the order of ~0.05 dex. This supports a picture where **satellites gradually build higher metallicities once removed from the cosmic gas supply**, because ongoing star formation enriches their remaining gas without dilution from fresh infall.

**Evidence for Strangulation:** The above trend – modest metallicity increases in satellites – aligns with the **“strangulation” scenario** (Peng et al. 2015), wherein a galaxy entering a cluster has its external cold gas supply shut off. The galaxy continues forming stars using existing gas, which elevates the gas-phase metallicity over time (no metal-poor accretion to dilute the ISM). **Maier et al. (2016)** provided direct evidence for strangulation in clusters. They observed star-forming members of cluster MACS J0416 (at *z* ~ 0.4) and compared them to field galaxies. Using phase-space analysis to distinguish recently infallen galaxies from long-term cluster residents, they found that **infalling cluster galaxies lie on the normal Fundamental Metallicity Relation (mass–metallicity–SFR relation), whereas galaxies that have been in the cluster longer exhibit **metallicities higher than predicted by that relation**. Specifically, **accreted low-mass cluster galaxies (\*M\* < 10^9.2 M_⊙) had O/H values 2–3× (0.3–0.5 dex) above those expected for their mass and SFR**. Intermediate-mass satellites (M★ ~10^9.2–10^10.2) that were accreted earlier also showed an **O/H excess** relative to similar field galaxies. These **metal-enriched cluster galaxies** could only be explained by models in which **gas inflow was halted at infall** – i.e. strangulation – allowing metals to build up. In contrast, cluster galaxies identified as first-infallers (still acquiring gas) had metallicities consistent with the usual MZR/FMR expected for their ongoing SFR. Thus, cluster environment effects strongly influence chemical evolution: **satellite galaxies, especially low-mass ones, rapidly become over-enriched once deprived of fresh gas**.

**Intermediate Redshift Clusters:** Recent work indicates that environment-driven metallicity effects become more complex at intermediate redshifts, with **both metal enhancement and dilution occurring within clusters**. A detailed study of star-forming members in cluster **AC114 at z = 0.317** (Andrade et al. 2024) found that the **cluster’s MZR has higher scatter and a slightly shallower slope** than the field MZR at the same redshift. Interestingly, AC114 galaxies were *not uniformly metal-rich* – instead, two trends emerged. A few cluster members lie **above** the field MZR (by ~0.1 dex in O/H), consistent with the strangulation/RPS-induced enrichment seen in local studies. However, a significant fraction of AC114 galaxies were **more metal-poor than field counterparts** of the same mass (by up to ~0.2 dex). These lower-metallicity outliers flatten the overall MZR slope in the cluster. Andrade et al. attribute the metal-poor cases to **strong inflows or interactions**: in the cluster outskirts and substructures, galaxy–galaxy interactions or mergers can trigger inflow of metal-poor gas (from the IGM or galaxy halos), temporarily **diluting the gas-phase metallicity**. Meanwhile, galaxies in the dense core show signs of **ram-pressure stripping and strangulation**, which tend to **raise** their metallicities. Thus, **multiple environmental processes compete**: some cluster galaxies experience **metallicity boosts** (via gas removal/quenching of star formation), while others get **metallicity deficits** (via inflows during harassment or mergers). The net result is **a broad MZR scatter** in clusters. Notably, the most massive clusters may induce a flatter MZR slope – AC114 (a very massive cluster, M_vir > 10^15 M_⊙) shows a measurable slope change – whereas smaller groups have weaker impact. Overall, by *z* ~0.3 the cluster environment is actively perturbing the chemical content of galaxies, yielding both **enriched quiescent satellites and transiently diluted starbursts**, which together increase the dispersion in metallicities.

**Protoclusters at High-z:** In the distant universe (*z* ≳ 2), environmental effects on metallicity appear to have been **mild or even opposite to local trends**. A recent study using the VANDELS survey examined galaxies in overdensities at *z* ~ 2–4. They found that galaxies in the **densest protocluster regions had slightly \*lower\* metallicities on average** than similar field galaxies – roughly 0.1 dex lower in gas-phase O/H (and ~0.2 dex lower in stellar metallicity). This offset was only marginally significant (≈2σ) but suggests that at high redshifts, **cluster galaxies were less chemically enriched**, likely because they were younger and still furiously forming stars. The metallicity deficit could not be explained by simple sample selection effects (it persisted after accounting for SFR, age, dust, etc.). Instead, the authors propose that **protocluster environments might promote metal loss or dilution**: e.g. **frequent mergers and interactions** in dense regions can drive **metal-poor gas inflows**, while **strong AGN feedback or galactic winds** in massive halos might expel metal-rich gas. Essentially, at *z* ~3 the cluster environment might *delay* chemical enrichment via turbulent gas dynamics, whereas by *z* ~0 it *accelerates* apparent enrichment via starvation. Current simulations struggle to reproduce any metallicity difference at high z – many models predict no significant MZR shift with environment – implying that some processes in dense protocluster cores (e.g. rapid gas cycling, intra-cluster mixing) are not fully captured and need to be included explicitly.

**Summary of MZR Environmental Effects:** In summary, **low-z clusters** impart a small upward shift in the MZR (satellites are slightly more metal-rich than field galaxies of the same mass), mainly due to the **cessation of pristine gas inflow (strangulation)** that causes gradual enrichment. They also produce **flatter metallicity gradients** and high metallicity scatter, as discussed below. **Higher-z clusters** show either no MZR difference or even a downward shift (metal dilution), reflecting the evolving balance of processes (inflows vs. outflows vs. quenching) in dense environments. The overall impact on the global MZR is modest – environment is a *secondary* effect compared to stellar mass – but it is measurable with large samples. Importantly, **cluster-related processes must be accounted for in models**: the small metallicity offsets (~~0.05 dex) observed at z~~0 are real, and a simulations that omit environment-specific physics (RPS, tidal stripping, etc.) tend to miss these subtle trends. The agreement between observations and models improves when such processes are included, reinforcing that **environment plays a role in galaxy chemical evolution, especially for lower-mass cluster satellites**.

## Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR) and Environment

The **fundamental metallicity relation** (FMR) extends the MZR by incorporating star formation rate: it posits a tight 3D relation between stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, and SFR for star-forming galaxies (often described as a surface where high-SFR galaxies at a given mass have slightly lower O/H, and low-SFR galaxies have higher O/H). An important question is whether cluster environment causes deviations from the **universal FMR** established mostly from field galaxies. The evidence suggests that **environmental quenching can indeed perturb the FMR**, especially for satellites that have significantly lowered SFRs.

As mentioned, **Maier et al. (2016)** found that **star-forming galaxies already accreted into a cluster exhibit metallicities above the standard FMR**. In MACS J0416 at *z* ~0.4, intermediate-mass accreted members were **over-enriched for their SFRs**, and the lowest-mass ones had metallicities far above what FMR (or “bathtub” inflow models) would predict. These galaxies had low specific SFRs (having begun quenching), yet unexpectedly high O/H – precisely the signature of strangulation. The **infalling galaxies** (still actively forming stars) lay on the usual FMR, indicating no intrinsic difference prior to cluster entry. Thus, **the cluster environment causes galaxies to move off the canonical FMR track**: as their SFR drops (due to gas removal) their metallicity becomes *too high* for the new, lower SFR. In effect, they **“overshoot” the FMR plane** by becoming chemically enriched faster than their star formation is declining. This overshoot grows with decreasing mass, since low-mass satellites are most strongly affected by stripping and have less dilution from any residual inflows.

Conversely, a galaxy undergoing a sudden **gas inflow or starburst** in a cluster (e.g. due to a tidal interaction or group merger) might temporarily lie *below* the normal FMR (lower metallicity for its SFR). Such cases are observed in the form of those **diluted, metal-poor cluster galaxies** in AC114 and other merging substructures. They have elevated SFRs (or recent star formation) and lowered metallicities, making them **FMR outliers in the opposite sense**. However, these tend to be transient – after the burst, they may enrich quickly.

Taken together, the cluster environment **increases the scatter about the FMR** by adding galaxies that deviate to either side (over-enriched quenching systems and under-enriched interacting systems). The general **SFR–Z anti-correlation** of the FMR still qualitatively holds in clusters – i.e. cluster galaxies with very low SFRs tend to have high metallicities – but the **calibration shifts**. For instance, **Peng & Maiolino (2014)** noted that at fixed mass and SFR, satellites have slightly higher metallicity than centrals, meaning the FMR zero-point for satellites is elevated by a small amount (consistent with strangulation). **Schaefer et al. (2019)**, using MaNGA, similarly found star-forming *satellites* are ~0.05 dex more metal-rich than star-forming *centrals* on average, even when controlling for SFR. This subtle shift can be seen as an **environmental modification of the FMR** – one that any comprehensive FMR model should include. In fact, some authors speak of an “extended” fundamental relation including environment (e.g. halo mass or overdensity as a fourth parameter) because of these small systematic offsets.

In summary, **cluster environments do not invalidate the FMR but do cause systematic offsets for satellite galaxies**. Long-time cluster members tend to sit at higher metallicity (above the original FMR), reflecting their throttled gas supply and declining SFR. Newly infalling cluster galaxies adhere to the standard FMR until environmental processes kick in. Any complete theory of the FMR across cosmic time needs to account for environment-driven effects such as strangulation and bursts triggered by interactions. The observations to date strongly support the idea that **environmental processes (e.g. gas removal) are central to understanding why cluster galaxies have the metallicities they do at their current SFRs**, especially in the low-SFR, near-quenched regime.

## Resolved Studies: Metallicity Gradients and Spatially Resolved SF in Clusters

Beyond global relations, **spatially resolved observations** have shed light on how environment affects the **internal distribution of star formation and metals** within cluster galaxies:

- **Gas-Phase Metallicity Gradients:** Star-forming galaxies in the field typically show **negative metallicity gradients** (higher O/H in the center, declining outward), reflecting inside-out growth. In cluster satellites, these gradients are often **significantly flatter (less negative)**. Using **IFU surveys** like SDSS-IV MaNGA, researchers have quantified this environmental flattening. **Lian et al. (2019)** found that **low-mass satellite galaxies in denser environments have much flatter oxygen abundance profiles** than similar galaxies in low-density environs. At the same time, their star formation surface density profiles are more centrally concentrated (steeper Σ_SFR gradients), indicating outer disk quenching. In other words, a typical cluster dwarf might lose its low-metallicity outer gas (via stripping), so its remaining star-forming region is confined to the already-enriched center – yielding a flat overall gradient. Consistently, **Franchetto et al. (2021)** compared cluster vs. field spirals (using MUSE observations in the GASP project) and found that **at any given stellar mass, cluster galaxies have systematically flatter metallicity gradients than field galaxies**. The difference can be subtle but measurable: for example, **Lara-López et al. (2022)** observed 10 Fornax Cluster galaxies with MUSE and reported their metallicity gradients are on average **∆(log O/H)/∆R_e ~0.04 dex per R_e \*shallower\*** (i.e. higher in the outskirts) compared to a control sample. This median offset, though small, aligns with the idea that **cluster galaxies retain more metals in their outer regions** (or lose more low-metallicity gas) than field galaxies. Put simply, **cluster environment tends to **“erase” metallicity gradients**, making the outer disk metallicity closer to the central value. The likely cause is **ram-pressure stripping of the outer disk gas**: as the metal-poor outskirts are removed, the metallicity difference between center and edge diminishes. Additionally, any **gas mixing or accretion of enriched intra-cluster material** could contribute to raising outer metallicity. Notably, **no significant enhancement in central metallicity gradients has been detected** – the primary effect is gradient *flattening* rather than steepening, indicating environment works mainly by altering the outer parts of galaxies. These findings are echoed by simulations; for instance, cosmological models that include stripping show flattened gradients for satellites, whereas models without environmental effects do not reproduce this trend.
- **Star Formation Distribution and “Outside-In” Quenching:** Resolved Hα and UV imaging of cluster spirals (e.g. in Virgo) dramatically illustrate **truncated star-forming disks**. Many cluster spirals have their star formation confined to the inner regions, with **outer disks deficient in H II regions** – a classic sign of ram-pressure stripping sweeping out gas from the outside inward. The **VESTIGE survey** (deep Hα imaging of Virgo) reveals numerous examples of **one-sided and centrally concentrated Hα emission** in cluster galaxies (the so-called “jellyfish” galaxies being extreme cases of this). Boselli et al. (2023) quantitatively showed that **Virgo galaxies’ HI deficiency correlates with suppressed star formation in their outer disk**, leading to much lower total SFR at fixed mass. In spatially resolved terms, the **resolved SFMS** (relation between local Σ_SFR and local stellar mass surface density) still exists in cluster galaxies’ inner parts, but the **outer parts fall below the relation** because star formation has ceased there. This effect can be seen in CO and HI mapping as well: e.g., ALMA observations (VERTICO project) find that cluster spirals often have **truncated CO disks** and lower molecular gas content in the outskirts, corresponding to where star formation is quenched (yet their central molecular reservoirs may remain intact for some time). The end result is an **“inside-out” quenching**: cluster galaxies stop forming stars from the outer disk inward. This process is relatively fast – once a galaxy’s outer gas is stripped, the remaining gas in the inner disk fuels star formation for a limited time (~ a few hundred Myr) until it too is consumed or stripped. This creates a moving “quenching front” that travels inward. Observationally, we see **strong color and Hα gradients** in such galaxies (blue star-forming core, red dead disk), and bright knots of star formation sometimes in the stripped tails outside the galaxy. Interestingly, those **extraplanar star-forming regions** (massive clumps formed in stripped gas tails) can have extremely high specific SFRs – essentially starbursting **above** the usual SFMS – but they are short-lived. They may contribute to forming compact stellar systems in clusters (like tidal dwarfs or UCDs) before fading.

In summary, **spatially resolved studies reinforce the picture of environmental transformations:** cluster galaxies lose their low-density, low-metallicity peripheral gas, leading to **flatter metallicity gradients and truncated star-forming disks**. The SF and metallicity structural changes are two sides of the same coin – as the **outer disk is quenched and stripped, its low-metallicity gas is gone**, so the remaining gas is more enriched and concentrated. These internal changes precede and accompany the galaxy’s move off the global scaling relations. By the time a cluster galaxy is fully quenched, it typically has a flat/high metallicity throughout (akin to an early-type galaxy) and no star formation beyond the nucleus. **Environmental effects, therefore, are clearly imprinted in the resolved properties of cluster galaxies**, providing a more nuanced understanding of how cluster membership alters galaxy evolution beyond the global SFMS and MZR trends.

## Conclusion and Theoretical Context

Collectively, the research to date paints a consistent physical picture: **environmental processes in clusters – ram-pressure stripping, strangulation (starvation), tidal interactions, and mergers – have measurable but varied impacts on galaxy scaling relations.** In low-redshift clusters, the dominant effect is the **quenching of star formation in satellites**, which manifests as many galaxies dropping off the SF main sequence (or having reduced SFR for their mass) and a slight elevation in their gas-phase metallicities at fixed mass. The **mass–metallicity relation in clusters acquires a higher normalization by ~0.05 dex** for satellite galaxies, consistent with the idea that they stop accreting fresh gas and thus become more metal-rich on average. **Fundamental metallicity relation deviations** are observed in exactly the manner expected from quenching: at a given mass and SFR, cluster satellites (especially long-term members) have higher metallicity than field galaxies, indicating the FMR must be “bent” to accommodate environmental quenching. Spatially, **cluster galaxies undergo outside-in truncation of star formation and a flattening of metallicity gradients**, directly reflecting the removal of outer disk gas.

It is important to emphasize that these **environmental effects are most pronounced for lower-mass galaxies**. Massive galaxies often have quenched by internal (mass-driven) processes (“mass quenching”) before environment matters, which is why the MZR differences between centrals and satellites vanish at high masses. But for **dwarf and intermediate-mass galaxies**, environment is a key driver of their star formation and chemical history. These findings are supported by simulations only when the appropriate physics is included. For example, semi-analytic models that incorporate ram-pressure stripping and starvation can produce satellite metallicity enhancements and SF truncation consistent with observations, whereas models without such environmental physics predict satellites nearly identical to field galaxies. The **tension between some simulations and observed small offsets** (e.g. no MZR difference predicted vs. 0.05 dex observed) highlights the need to model cluster-specific processes explicitly.

In conclusion, **numerous studies across different redshifts and using diverse techniques (optical spectroscopy, IFU mapping, radio/mm observations of gas)** have addressed the **SFMS, MZR, and FMR of cluster galaxies**. The consensus is that **environment plays a measurable role, especially at low redshift**:

- **Star-Forming Main Sequence:** Same slope as field but lower normalization for some cluster galaxies and much higher scatter, due to gas stripping that suppresses SFR in satellites. High-*z* clusters show little SFR suppression, indicating quenching is a later-time phenomenon.
- **Mass–Metallicity Relation:** Small upward shift in cluster satellites’ metallicities (~0.03–0.05 dex) in the local universe, attributable to cut-off of metal-poor inflow (strangulation). At intermediate *z*, cluster MZRs show increased scatter: some galaxies enriched by cluster processes, others diluted by interactions. At very high *z*, cluster/protocluster galaxies can actually be less enriched than field galaxies, likely because environmental processes were disruptive (inducing inflows/outflows) rather than simply quenching.
- **Fundamental Metallicity Relation:** Cluster galaxies deviate in a manner consistent with environmental quenching – quenched or gas-poor cluster galaxies have too high a metallicity for their low SFR (above the standard FMR), confirming strangulation, while interaction-triggered starbursts can dip below the FMR. The overall FMR holds in form but with an environment-dependent zero-point or scatter.
- **Resolved Properties:** Cluster environment leads to **flatter metallicity gradients** (outer regions more enriched) and **truncated star-forming regions** (outer disk SF removed) in satellites. These are direct signatures of ram-pressure stripping and fast gas removal, which primarily affect galaxy outskirts. Such resolved evidence strongly supports the physical mechanisms inferred from global relations.

All these results converge on a narrative that **cluster environments significantly influence galaxy evolution at low redshift**, primarily by removing or heating gas and thus quenching star formation, with secondary effects on chemical enrichment. Early in the universe, clusters were still assembling, so their impact was weaker – but by today, **cluster galaxies carry the imprint of their environment in their star formation activity and abundances.** Researchers continue to study these trends with better data (e.g. JWST for high-z clusters, upcoming large IFU surveys) and more sophisticated simulations, to fully untangle how environment and internal processes jointly shape the life cycle of galaxies. The existing literature clearly demonstrates that **environmental effects on SFMS, MZR, and related relations are real and observable**, even if subtle, and must be accounted for in any complete model of galaxy formation and evolution.

The conclusions broadly agree: **environment matters**, but mainly by accelerating the quenching of star formation – a process whose signatures we can detect in both the **suppressed star formation rates** and the **enhanced metallicities** of cluster galaxies relative to their field counterparts.
