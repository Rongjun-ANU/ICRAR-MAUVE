I go back to check NGC4396, but I dont spot anything unusual. I guess if we want to check radiation field, we may need to calcualte the ionization parameters, etc. 

## rMZR dependent on local property $\rm \Sigma_{SFR}$? 

Instead of showing rMZR of individual galaxy, I regroup them in different SFR bins.

Unfortunately, I do not observe any anti-correlation between $\rm \Sigma_{SFR}$ and [O/H]. I suspect this may due to lack of complete data in $\Sigma_*<7.8M_\odot/kpc^2$, which is the regime that Koller+2024 report that anti-correlation:

## rMZR dependent on global property $\log(M_*)$? 

Actually, it seems that rMZR is still sensitive to total stellar mass: low-mass galaxies are a bit metal-poorer?

Also show the rSFMS in different total stellar mass bins:

As a comparison, below is Figure 7 from Baker+2023:

![Same as Fig. 1, but where the galaxies are divided into three bins of total stellar mass, M*, as indicated on the top of each panel. The figure illustrates that the local metallicity has also a dependence on total stellar mass and that the inverse correlation with Î£SFR is strongest for low-mass galaxies. As a common reference, the density contours are the same as for the total population in Fig. 1.](assets/m_stac3594fig3.jpeg)
