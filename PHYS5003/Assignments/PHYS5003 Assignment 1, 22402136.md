##  Background and Motivation

Galactic winds generated by intense star formation are thought to regulate the growth of galaxies and to pre-enrich the circum-galactic medium with metals.  Because they evolve on kiloparsec scales, direct tests of theoretical prescriptions have relied on nearby archetypes.  M82, only 3.6 Mpc away and observed almost edge-on (with a disk inclination of $80^\circ$), displays a biconical X-ray outflow that has been followed from the disk to several kiloparsecs above the mid-plane.  Yet the internal structure of that wind—its temperature profile, metal content, and the role of mass loading—remains debated because most previous analyses blended spectra over large apertures.  Lopez et al. (2020) revisit the problem with half-kiloparsec spatial resolution using Chandra X-ray Observatory imaging and spectra, providing a continuous map of temperature and metallicity along the outflows and setting new constraints on wind launching models.

##  Observations and Spectrum Fitting

The study combines six deep Chandra ACIS-S pointings obtained in 2009–2010 (total effective exposure 467 ks) with three earlier observations, all reprocessed uniformly with CIAO 4.10.  Eleven rectangular regions were defined: a $0.5\times1.5$ kpc strip across the starburst disk plus five extended rectangles to the north (above) and south (below) of the disc, reaching $|z| \approx 2.5$ kpc.  Discrete sources and read-out streaks were masked to isolate genuinely diffuse emission.  Spectra from each region were fitted simultaneously in XSPEC over 0.5–7 keV with a composite model that includes up to three optically thin thermal plasmas (vapec), an empirical charge-exchange component, and a power-law continuum.  Abundances of oxygen (O), neon (Ne), magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), sulfer (S), and iron (Fe) were fixed across different thermal components within a region, while intrinsic absorption and plasma temperatures were allowed to vary.

##  Thermal Structure of the Outflow

Two thermal plasmas suffice for most off-plane regions: a warm–hot component at 0.35–0.7 keV and a hotter phase at 0.8–1.7 keV.  A third, very hot component near 7 keV is required only in the central disc, where the Fe XXV line is detected.  The flux-weighted temperature declines from roughly 0.7 keV in the disk to 0.3 keV at $|z| \approx 2.5$ kpc.  The accompanying electron-density profile inferred from emission measures falls approximately as $r^{-1}$.  Both scalings are significantly flatter than the $r^{-4/3}$ temperature and $r^{-2}$ density predicted for a freely expanding, adiabatic Chevalier–Clegg wind. This pheonmeon suggests a substantial mass entrainment or cooling as the flow advances.

##  Chemical Composition and Radial Gradients

Outside the central 0.5 kpc, the abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe fluctuate near solar levels with no significant trend.  In contrast, Si and S reach 2.5–3.5 $Z_\odot$ in the inner 3 regions before declining toward solar farther out.  The pattern suggests two distinct enrichment channels: well-mixed ejecta from older supernovae dominate the bulk of the cone, while freshly exploded core-collapse supernovae within the starburst core inject Si and S that have not yet propagated beyond half a kiloparsec.  The absence of a corresponding O enhancement argues that the lowest mass progenitors, which contribute strongly to oxygen yields, exploded earlier and their products are already diluted throughout the outflow.

##  Non-thermal and Interface Emission

A charge-exchange template improves every fit and contributes between eight and twenty-five percent of the intrinsic 0.5–7 keV luminosity, with the largest fractions appearing where the intrinsic column density is lowest.  This behaviour implies that hot plasma continues to interact with cold entrained clouds well beyond the launch region.  The power-law term, fixed to a photon index of 1.5, supplies about thirteen percent of the band-limited luminosity and is most prominent in the disk, consistent with a mix of unresolved high-mass X-ray binaries and inverse-Compton scattering.

##  Physical Interpretation

The combination of shallow thermodynamic gradients and spatially varying α-element enrichment points to vigorous mixing between the supernova-driven wind fluid and ambient interstellar or halo gas.  Mass loading slows the wind, increases its density, and cools it, bringing the temperature profile into agreement with the observations.  If the 7 keV component traces the genuine launch zone, the implied supernova thermalisation efficiency is high ($\alpha\approx0.6$) and the initial mass-loading factor low ($\beta\approx0.1$).  However, adopting emission-weighted values yields considerably lower $\alpha$ and $\beta$, illustrating how unresolved mixing biases global energetic estimates.  The detection of charge-exchange emission along the full minor axis reinforces numerical predictions that turbulent mixing layers are pervasive and may seed the warm ionised filaments seen in optical lines. 

##  Implications for Feedback Models

Resolved measurements in M82 caution against interpreting galaxy-integrated X-ray spectra with single-temperature models.  Metal yields inferred without accounting for multiphase structure or for charge-exchange contamination can err by factors of two or more.  The near-solar $\alpha$/Fe ratios observed out to several kiloparsecs confirm that metal-rich gas can escape the gravitational potential of a dwarf starburst within a few tens of megayears, providing a plausible pathway for the early enrichment of low-mass galaxy halos at intermediate redshifts.  Future missions equipped with arcsecond imaging calorimeters, such as XRISM (start to observe from 2024), Athena X-IFU, and proposed Lynx concepts, will extend the M82 experiment to a statistically significant sample and will directly measure line broadening, thereby closing the mass-loading budget.

##  Conclusions

Lopez et al. (2020) provide a detailed X-ray study of the starburst wind from M82.  They find that temperature and density profiles decline far more gradually than predicted by adiabatic theory, a result best explained by substantial mass entrainment.  Oxygen, neon, magnesium, and iron are uniformly mixed, while silicon and sulfur exhibit central peaks that trace very recent supernova activity.  Charge-exchange and non-thermal continua together account for roughly one-third of the 0.5–7 keV photons and must be modelled to avoid biased metallicities.  M82 thus remains a cornerstone for understanding how stellar feedback redistributes metals and energy, placing empirical bounds on the sub-grid recipes used in cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution.

Summary is done, but I want to add some comments here. Lopez et al. (2020) suggest that temperature and metallicities's gradients in galactic outflows of M82 is due to the mixing of multiphase gases. This idea is correct and also verified by the simulation. However, the quality of Chandra data, especially the spectra, is quite low (i.e., quite low flux-weighted mean signal-to-noise ratio: $3\sim5$). Thus, their deduction is correct, but some observations like absence of prominent gradient in O, Ne, Mg, and Fe are actually debated, probably due to poor data. Can XRISM really imporve this? I personally do not expect XRISM can improve the data quality because it is not designed for spatially resolved imaging.
